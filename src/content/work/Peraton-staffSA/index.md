* Solutions Architect for the Civil and Health Business unit. As a part of a group of eight solutions architects we provided capture support and guidance, ad-hoc support to programs on an as needed basis and assisted in develping technical strategy and vision for the business unit.</p>

* Participated in capture efforts as technical lead and solutions architect with estimated new business value for Peraton of over $2 billion dollars.</p>

* Automated the management, build and distribution of CSSG golden AMI's. Using the AWS EC2 Image Builder service I developed custom components, recipes and pipelines that ensured CSSG and CSSG customers adhered to Peraton InfoSec guidance with respect to AMIs. AMIs managed included Red Hat and CentOS 7, Amazon Linux 2, as well as Windows and SQL Server 2016 and 2019. All components were managed by CloudFormation, simplifyihg management and update of the various components.</p>

* Developed CloudFormation templates to integrate with CSSG ServiceNow platform creating service offerings for customers. These offerings allowed CSSG customers to launch pre-approved services in a repeatable fashion from ServiceNow that were pre-approved by InfoSec. This also helped reduce CSSG work by automating tasks CSSG admins or architects previously had to perform for the projects.</p>
