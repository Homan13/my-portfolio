## Problem 1


The Historians push the button on their strange device, but this time, you all just feel like you're falling.

"Situation critical", the device announces in a familiar voice. "Bootstrapping process failed. Initializing debugger...."

The small handheld device suddenly unfolds into an entire computer! The Historians look around nervously before one of them tosses it to you.

This seems to be a 3-bit computer: its program is a list of 3-bit numbers (0 through 7), like 0,1,2,3. The computer also has three registers named A, B, and C, but these registers aren't limited to 3 bits and can instead hold any integer.

The computer knows eight instructions, each identified by a 3-bit number (called the instruction's opcode). Each instruction also reads the 3-bit number after it as an input; this is called its operand.

A number called the instruction pointer identifies the position in the program from which the next opcode will be read; it starts at 0, pointing at the first 3-bit number in the program. Except for jump instructions, the instruction pointer increases by 2 after each instruction is processed (to move past the instruction's opcode and its operand). If the computer tries to read an opcode past the end of the program, it instead halts.

So, the program 0,1,2,3 would run the instruction whose opcode is 0 and pass it the operand 1, then run the instruction having opcode 2 and pass it the operand 3, then halt.

There are two types of operands; each instruction specifies the type of its operand. The value of a literal operand is the operand itself. For example, the value of the literal operand 7 is the number 7. The value of a combo operand can be found as follows:

Combo operands 0 through 3 represent literal values 0 through 3.
Combo operand 4 represents the value of register A.
Combo operand 5 represents the value of register B.
Combo operand 6 represents the value of register C.
Combo operand 7 is reserved and will not appear in valid programs.
The eight instructions are as follows:

The adv instruction (opcode 0) performs division. The numerator is the value in the A register. The denominator is found by raising 2 to the power of the instruction's combo operand. (So, an operand of 2 would divide A by 4 (2^2); an operand of 5 would divide A by 2^B.) The result of the division operation is truncated to an integer and then written to the A register.

The bxl instruction (opcode 1) calculates the bitwise XOR of register B and the instruction's literal operand, then stores the result in register B.

The bst instruction (opcode 2) calculates the value of its combo operand modulo 8 (thereby keeping only its lowest 3 bits), then writes that value to the B register.

The jnz instruction (opcode 3) does nothing if the A register is 0. However, if the A register is not zero, it jumps by setting the instruction pointer to the value of its literal operand; if this instruction jumps, the instruction pointer is not increased by 2 after this instruction.

The bxc instruction (opcode 4) calculates the bitwise XOR of register B and register C, then stores the result in register B. (For legacy reasons, this instruction reads an operand but ignores it.)

The out instruction (opcode 5) calculates the value of its combo operand modulo 8, then outputs that value. (If a program outputs multiple values, they are separated by commas.)

The bdv instruction (opcode 6) works exactly like the adv instruction except that the result is stored in the B register. (The numerator is still read from the A register.)

The cdv instruction (opcode 7) works exactly like the adv instruction except that the result is stored in the C register. (The numerator is still read from the A register.)

Here are some examples of instruction operation:

If register C contains 9, the program 2,6 would set register B to 1.
If register A contains 10, the program 5,0,5,1,5,4 would output 0,1,2.
If register A contains 2024, the program 0,1,5,4,3,0 would output 4,2,5,6,7,7,7,7,3,1,0 and leave 0 in register A.
If register B contains 29, the program 1,7 would set register B to 26.
If register B contains 2024 and register C contains 43690, the program 4,0 would set register B to 44354.
The Historians' strange device has finished initializing its debugger and is displaying some information about the program it is trying to run (your puzzle input). For example:

Register A: 729
Register B: 0
Register C: 0

Program: 0,1,5,4,3,0
Your first task is to determine what the program is trying to output. To do this, initialize the registers to the given values, then run the given program, collecting any output produced by out instructions. (Always join the values produced by out instructions with commas.) After the above program halts, its final output will be 4,6,3,5,6,3,5,2,1,0.

Using the information provided by the debugger, initialize the registers to the given values, then run the program. Once it halts, what do you get if you use commas to join the values it output into a single string?

As a junior developer, I'll break down Problem 33 and provide a detailed explanation of how we might approach it.
Problem Breakdown:
This problem involves simulating a simple 3-bit computer with three registers (A, B, C) and eight instructions. We need to initialize the registers with given values, run a program, and collect the output.
Inputs:
Initial register values (from the input file):
Register A: 21539243
Register B: 0
Register C: 0
Program (from the input file):
2,4,1,3,7,5,1,5,0,3,4,1,5,5,3,0
Outputs:
A string of comma-separated values produced by the 'out' instruction during program execution.
Constraints:
The computer uses 3-bit instructions (0-7).
Registers can hold any integer value.
The instruction pointer starts at 0 and usually increases by 2 after each instruction.
There are specific rules for each instruction (adv, bxl, bst, jnz, bxc, out, bdv, cdv).
Approach:
Parse the input file to get initial register values and the program.
Create a function for each instruction (adv, bxl, bst, etc.).
Implement a main loop to execute the program:
Read the current instruction and operand.
Execute the corresponding instruction function.
Update the instruction pointer.
Collect output from 'out' instructions.
Join the collected output values with commas and return the result.

This code attempts to simulate the 3-bit computer as described in the problem. However, as a junior developer, I might have missed some nuances or made some mistakes. For example, I'm not sure if I've correctly implemented the combo operands or if I'm handling the instruction pointer correctly in all cases. It would be good to have a senior developer review this code and provide feedback on areas that need improvement or correction.

Here's a detailed recap of our journey solving Problem 33:
Initial Challenges:
Misunderstanding the problem context: We initially confused this problem with a previous one about warehouse navigation.
Incorrect implementation of the 3-bit computer instructions: Our first attempts didn't accurately simulate the described computer operations.
Improper handling of combo operands: We struggled to correctly interpret operands as either literal values or register references.
Key Actions and Changes:
Clarified problem requirements: We carefully re-read the problem statement to understand the 3-bit computer's architecture and instruction set.
Implemented correct operand handling: We created a function to properly interpret combo operands (0-3 as literals, 4-6 as register values).
Accurate instruction implementation: We rewrote each instruction (adv, bxl, bst, jnz, bxc, out, bdv, cdv) to match the problem description.
Used a dictionary for registers: This allowed for easier management and access of register values.
Implemented proper program execution logic: We correctly handled the instruction pointer and program flow, including the jump instruction (jnz).
Improved output collection: We ensured that only the 'out' instruction contributed to the final output.
Final Solution Approach:
Parse input to initialize registers and load the program.
Implement each instruction as a separate function or case in a match statement.
Execute the program by iterating through instructions, updating registers and collecting output.
Handle combo operands correctly for each instruction that uses them.
Ensure proper modulo 8 operations where required.
Collect and format the output as a comma-separated string of values.
These changes allowed us to correctly simulate the 3-bit computer and produce the accurate output of 6,7,5,2,1,3,5,1,7 for the given input.

## Problem 2


Digging deeper in the device's manual, you discover the problem: this program is supposed to output another copy of the program! Unfortunately, the value in register A seems to have been corrupted. You'll need to find a new value to which you can initialize register A so that the program's output instructions produce an exact copy of the program itself.

For example:

Register A: 2024
Register B: 0
Register C: 0

Program: 0,3,5,4,3,0
This program outputs a copy of itself if register A is instead initialized to 117440. (The original initial value of register A, 2024, is ignored.)

What is the lowest positive initial value for register A that causes the program to output a copy of itself?

As a junior developer, I'll break down Problem 34 and provide a detailed explanation of how we might approach it.
Problem Breakdown:
We need to find the lowest positive initial value for Register A that will make the program output a copy of itself. The program and initial values for Registers B and C remain the same as in Problem 33.
Inputs:
Initial register values:
Register A: Unknown (we need to find this)
Register B: 0
Register C: 0
Program (from the input file):
2,4,1,3,7,5,1,5,0,3,4,1,5,5,3,0
Outputs:
The program should output an exact copy of itself: 2,4,1,3,7,5,1,5,0,3,4,1,5,5,3,0
Constraints:
We need to find the lowest positive value for Register A.
The program's behavior remains the same as in Problem 33.
We need to simulate the program's execution for different values of Register A.
Approach:
Start with a function that simulates the program's execution (from Problem 33).
Create a new function to check if the output matches the input program.
Implement a loop that tries increasing values for Register A until we find a match.
Optimize the search if possible (e.g., using binary search instead of linear search).

This code attempts to find the lowest positive value for Register A that makes the program output a copy of itself. However, as a junior developer, I have some concerns:
Efficiency: This brute-force approach might take a very long time for large values of Register A.
Accuracy: I'm not sure if I've implemented the program simulation correctly or if there are edge cases I'm missing.
Termination: There's a risk that this loop might never terminate if no valid value for Register A exists.
It would be helpful to have a senior developer review this approach and suggest optimizations or alternative methods to solve this problem more efficiently.

Here's a detailed recap of our journey solving Problem 34:
Initial Challenges:
Misunderstanding the problem: We initially approached it as a simple simulation, not realizing the complexity of finding the correct initial value for Register A.
Infinite loop: Our first attempt at solving the problem resulted in an infinite loop, as we didn't account for the possibility of the program never halting.
Inefficient brute-force approach: We initially tried to increment Register A linearly, which was too slow for finding such a large number.
Key Actions and Changes:
Improved input parsing: We refined our input parsing to correctly handle the program instructions and register values.
Implemented efficient search algorithm: Instead of a linear search, we adopted a more sophisticated approach that worked backwards from the desired output.
Utilized modular arithmetic: We leveraged the fact that the program uses modulo 8 operations to optimize our search.
Implemented combo operand handling: We correctly interpreted combo operands as either literal values or register references.
Refined program simulation: We improved our simulation of the 3-bit computer to accurately reflect all instructions and their effects on registers.
Final Solution Approach:
Parse input to initialize registers and load the program.
Implement a backwards search algorithm, starting from the desired output and working towards possible initial values.
Use modular arithmetic to drastically reduce the search space.
Simulate the program execution for candidate values of Register A.
Verify that the output matches the input program for each level of the search.
These changes allowed us to efficiently find the correct initial value for Register A (216549846240877) that causes the program to output a copy of itself, successfully solving Problem 34.

Today's challenge involved simulating a 3-bit computer and solving two related problems. Here's a detailed recap of our journey:
Problem 33:
We were tasked with simulating a 3-bit computer with three registers (A, B, C) and eight instructions. The main challenges were:
Correctly parsing the input file to extract register values and program instructions.
Implementing the eight instructions accurately, especially handling combo operands.
Simulating the program execution and collecting the output.
Initially, we faced issues with input parsing and misinterpreting the combo operands. We overcame these by carefully reviewing the problem description and refactoring our code to handle combo operands correctly.
Key strategies:
Using a dictionary for registers for easier management.
Implementing a function to execute each instruction based on its opcode.
Ensuring correct handling of combo operands.
Collecting outputs properly from the 'out' instruction.
Problem 34:
This problem built upon Problem 33, requiring us to find the lowest positive initial value for Register A that would make the program output a copy of itself. The main challenges were:
Efficiently searching for the correct initial value of Register A.
Handling potentially large numbers and long execution times.
Initially, we attempted a brute-force approach, which resulted in an infinite loop. We then adapted a more sophisticated approach from a Reddit solution, which worked backwards from the desired output.
Key strategies:
Using modular arithmetic to reduce the search space.
Implementing a backwards search algorithm, starting from the desired output and working towards possible initial values.
Optimizing the program simulation to handle large numbers efficiently.
Lessons learned:
The importance of carefully reading and understanding the problem description.
The value of modular arithmetic in optimizing search algorithms.
The benefit of considering alternative approaches when faced with performance issues.
The importance of handling edge cases and potential infinite loops in simulations.
By applying these strategies and learning from our initial mistakes, we successfully solved both problems, with the final answer for Problem 34 being 216549846240877 as the lowest positive initial value for Register A.
